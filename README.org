* Scribbli Web

After more than a decade of re-writes due to my squabcous perfectionism, I have no words. Here is Scribbli, the least of it.

** Decisions

*** 2024-06-25
 - Start over in Django 5.0
   - Back to what I know best.
   - Just get it done, m8.
   - Not sure why I'm talking to myself via devlop, must really be dreading the rewrite.
 - Do not create a separate React client right now - use Django templates with htmx.
 - Remove the concept of regions (can add later if needed).
   - Regions existed as a Universe construct beneath worlds - giving users the ability to create infinitely nested locations. It might come back later, but for now let's keep it simple, yeah?

*** 2024-06-26
- Do not try anything fancy, keep it simple for now.
  - Use case: Tried to force a single view (~/~) to load a different view if user was logged in or not (Landing page if not logged in, homepage if logged in). Decided to keep it simple and just use two different urls.
- Do not use *slugs* for worlds, stories, etc.
  - Slugs add complexity for very little benefit.
  - Example complexity:  Which layer in Django should calculate the slug? Django signals? Override model.save? Create a custom form?
  - What are the benefits?
    - SEO? Most of the site will be behind a login wall.
    - Users knowing “at a glance” where they are? Most users will likely be accessing the site from an app or their phone.
